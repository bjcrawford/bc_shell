![](https://raw.github.com/bjcrawford/bc_shell/master/screen.png)

This program was created as a project for an Introduction to Systems Programming and Operating Systems course taken in the fall of 2014. This program consists of a very basic command line interpreter that is capable of launching programs (with or without concurrent execution) and handling input and output redirection (via the <, >, >>, and | operators). Currently, the shell only operates from the directory it is opened within (i.e., there is no change directory functionality).

This shell was written for use within a linux environment and the [executable](https://raw.github.com/bjcrawford/bc_shell/master/Release/Project2-bc_shell) provided was compiled using GCC within the Ubuntu 14.04 OS. Please see the included test procedures and results [document](https://raw.github.com/bjcrawford/bc_shell/master/Crawford,Brett-TestProcedures.docx) for more information.
